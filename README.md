# ❤️ Heart Disease Predictor

A **Heart Disease Prediction project** that uses patient medical data to analyze and predict the likelihood of heart disease. This project focuses on **data analysis and machine learning concepts** commonly used in healthcare analytics.

The dataset is provided in both **CSV** and **R data format**, making it suitable for experimentation in **Python or R**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. This project aims to:

* Analyze medical attributes related to heart health
* Identify patterns and correlations in the data
* Build a predictive model to estimate heart disease risk

It is ideal for **ML beginners**, **data science students**, and **healthcare analytics projects**.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset (`heart.csv`) typically includes features such as:

* Age
* Sex
* Chest pain type
* Resting blood pressure
* Cholesterol level
* Fasting blood sugar
* Maximum heart rate
* Exercise-induced angina
* Target (presence or absence of heart disease)
